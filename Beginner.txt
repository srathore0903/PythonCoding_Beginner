#Question 1 - Level - Easy 

#Write a Python program that takes radius as input from the user and Calculate the area of a Circle. 

Radius = float(input("Please Enter Radius of the Circle : "))
Area = 3.14* Radius * Radius 
print("The area of the circle using 3.14 as pi value is : "+str(Area))

#If you do not wish to use pi value as 3.14 you may import maths library and do the computation as mentioned below. 

from math import pi
Area_math = pi * Radius * Radius
print("The area of the circle using pi from Maths package is : "+str(Area_math))
