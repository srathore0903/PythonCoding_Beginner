#Question 1 - Level - Easy 

#Write a Python program that takes radius as input from the user and Calculate the area of a Circle. 

Radius = float(input("Please Enter Radius of the Circle : "))
Area = 3.14* Radius * Radius 
print("The area of the circle using 3.14 as pi value is : "+str(Area))

#If you do not wish to use pi value as 3.14 you may import maths library and do the computation as mentioned below. 

from math import pi
Area_math = pi * Radius * Radius
print("The area of the circle using pi from Maths package is : "+str(Area_math))

#Question 2 - Level - Easy 

#Write a python program that takes the input value as N and compute N+NN+NNN+NNNN

N = int(input("Enter the Value of N : "))
N1 = int("%s" % N)
N2 = int("%s%s" % (N,N))
N3 = int("%s%s%s" % (N,N,N))
N4 = int("%s%s%s%s" % (N,N,N,N))
print(N1+N2+N3+N4)
